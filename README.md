## react-tender-app
web app that displays the 10 latest available tenders. The application should also allow the businessman to search for available tenders through their title and description.



>  This website is a fully responsive react web app and it is also using the [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to its navigation. This webapp is also using [ the Tenders Guru API]([https://tenders.guru/hu/api],).
Please do note that the the Tenders Guru API has some errors. Their data is not in a right formart.

I had to pull the whole data then clean it and place it on json server. Spent a lot of time doing that.



> Aproach
  * build a fully responsive website.
  * use [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).
  * query data from a third party library using ` useEffect hook` with the `async` and `await` promise.
  * use  states around the application without any redux, just hooks.
